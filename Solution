## Solution
Microsoft could make the following adjustments to remedy these problems:

1. **Reintroduce a Unified Control Panel**: Access would be made easier by having advanced settings in one convenient area.
2. **Improve Search Functionality**: Users would find what they need more quickly if Windows Search were improved to consistently reveal hidden options.
3. **Improve Accessiblilty**: Users with limited dexterity might find it easier to use if all settings were accessible through keyboard shortcuts.
4. **"Advanced Mode" option**: If this were an option in the settings, experienced users may be able to access secret functions without overcrowding the default user interface.
5. **Improve Screen Reader Compatibility**: It would be better for visually impaired users if all settings were completely available using screen readers.
