## Solution
Microsoft could make the following adjustments to remedy these problems:

- **Reintroduce a Unified Control Panel**: Access would be made easier by having advanced settings in one convenient area.
- **Improve Search Functionality**: Users would find what they need more quickly if Windows Search were improved to consistently reveal hidden options.
- **Users with limited dexterity might find it easier to use if all settings were accessible through keyboard shortcuts.
- **By enabling a "Advanced Mode" option in the settings, users may be able to access secret functions without overcrowding the default user interface.
- **Improve Screen Reader Compatibility**: It would be better for visually impaired users if all settings were completely available using screen readers.
